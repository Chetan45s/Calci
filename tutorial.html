                <p>You might know all the formulas for math and science problems, but if you don't know how to use your scientific calculator, you'll never get the correct answer. Here's a quick review of how to recognize a scientific calculator, what the keys mean, and how to enter data correctly.</p>
                <h1><br><br>What Is a Scientific Calculator?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>First, you need to know how a scientific calculator is different from other calculators. There are three main types of calculators: basic, business, and scientific. You can't work chemistry, physics, engineering, or trigonometry problems on a basic or business calculator because they don't have functions you'll need to use. Scientific calculators include exponents, log, natural log (ln), trig functions, and memory. These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a geometry component. Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Business calculators include buttons for interest rates. They typically ignore the order of operations.</p>
                <br><br><h1>Scientific Calculator Functions</h1>
                <br><p>The buttons may be labeled differently depending on the manufacturer, but here is a list of common functions and what they mean:</p>

            <h1>How to Use a Scientific Calculator</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The obvious way to learn to use the calculator is to read the manual. If you got a calculator that didn't come with a manual, you can usually search for the model online and download a copy. Otherwise, you need to do a bit of experimentation or you'll enter in the right numbers and still get the wrong answer. The reason this happens is that different calculators process order of operations differently. For example, if your calculation is: <br><br>3 + 5 * 4 <br><br>You know, according to the order of operations, the 5 and the 4 should be multiplied by each other before adding the 3. Your calculator may or may not know this. If you press 3 + 5 x 4, some calculators will give you the answer 32 and others will give you 23 (which is correct). Find out what your calculator does. If you see an issue with the order of operations, you can either enter 5 x 4 + 3 (to get the multiplication out of the way) or use parentheses 3 + (5 x 4).</p>
